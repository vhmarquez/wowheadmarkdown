What are WeakAuras?
-------------------

[WeakAuras2](https://www.wowhead.com/weakauras-addon-guide) is an extremely flexible addon, with near limitless creative potential and control, capable of replicating or replacing nearly any part of the user interface. While designed as a simple way to create alerts to remind you of buffs, debuff, or encounter mechanics, it has become an integral part of World of Warcraft user interface customization, allowing players to replace their traditional action bars, create and share complex raid information, track other players spell casts, and much, much more. In this section, we've highlighted some of the best WeakAuras for Havoc Demon Hunter, although there are so many different options available that we *highly* recommend visiting [wago.io](https://www.wowhead.com/wago.io) to find one that best suits your needs.

Havoc DH WeakAuras
------------------

All of the WeakAuras below are created by the Author who uploaded them on wago.io and all credit belongs to them. This is just a compilation of ones I have found useful.

| WeakAura Title | Description | Link |
| Afenar | Demon Hunter | This is a suite that tracks everything you need for both Havoc and Vengeance, including all cooldowns and buffs, and dynamically updates with your talent selection. | <https://wago.io/Afenar_DH> |
| Luxthos | Demon Hunter | Secondary option, another suite that tracks everything you need for both Havoc and Vengeance, including all cooldowns, resources, and utilities. | <https://wago.io/LuxthosDemonHunterDragonflight> |

Creating your own WeakAuras
---------------------------

When you only need one WeakAura rather than a compilation, or if you simply can't find one that suits your needs, you can always make your own. For more complicated WeakAuras, you can take a look at our [extensive WeakAuras guide](https://www.wowhead.com/weakauras-addon-guide) or visit the [WeakAuras discord](https://discord.gg/wa2), but you can get basic Weak Aura support for every player spell right here on Wowhead!

Just visit any spell page (abilities, specialization, talents, azerite powers, PvP talents) and click on the red "WeakAuras Export" button to open the panel. From there, simply click "Copy" to use the default aura, or "Customize" to easily change your alerts!
