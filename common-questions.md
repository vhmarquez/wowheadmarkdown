Major Pitfalls
--------------

These are some of the most common mistakes / bad habits Havoc players might fall into the habit of doing and should work to fix. Identifying if you are doing these and correcting the issue will leave to a performance gain immediately.

* * * * *

-   Fury mismanagement: At the core of the gameplay of every spec in the game is resource management. Havoc is no different, and resource management has the potential to impact your output negatively if mismanaged greatly. The biggest thing to keep an eye out when talking about fury management will be the "overspending" of fury, though some builds also require managing building before a cooldown comes up. I'll go over the management of the more popular builds below.

-   Blind Fury Builds [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bosskilrogg_deadeye.gif) Blind Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203550/blind-fury) as a talent beefs up the value of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198013/eye-beam) by a significant value and it is almost exclusively paired with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonform.gif) Demonic](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213410/demonic). This means you will always want to cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198013/eye-beam) as soon as possible with no delay when it comes off cooldown, however to not overcap Fury you will want to manage your fury in advance of it coming off cooldown. Ideally you will be anywhere within 30-70 fury, and casting Eye Beam with Blind Fury will always max your fury out to 120 so any amount over 30 is wasted. You are fully reliant on being Proactive on your fury management to have a proper amount of fury for minimal waste when the cooldown comes up, without any holding.

-   FB/DB [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felblade.gif) Felblade](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213241/felblade) + [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_92.gif) Demon Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203555/demon-blades) In the past couple of expansions is a build combo we have commonly utilized. When we pair it with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonform.gif) Demonic](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213410/demonic) this means we do the opposite of Blind Fury builds and need to generate fury leading up to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198013/eye-beam) coming off of cooldown. You need to get close to max fury without overcapping, which can be difficult due to the RNG nature. Generally you play higher fury outside of your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonform.gif) Demonic](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213410/demonic) windows and hover in a more moderate level of fury so you can [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felblade.gif) Felblade](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213241/felblade) without overcapping, and get high on fury before Eye Beam comes off cooldown.

-   Tactical Retreat [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_vengefulretreat2.gif) Tactical Retreat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=389688/tactical-retreat) has its own ways required to play around its fury generation to not overcap. Generally also paired with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felblade.gif) Felblade](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213241/felblade) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_92.gif) Demon Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203555/demon-blades), You want to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_vengefulretreat2.gif) Vengeful Retreat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198793/vengeful-retreat) on cooldown while pairing it with Momentum damage windows, meaning you have to let fury build up before you Vengeful Retreat for your large DPS windows to spend ; but not high enough on fury to have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_vengefulretreat2.gif) Tactical Retreat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=389688/tactical-retreat) fury generation overcapping you at the start. Needless to say it can be difficult at times and requires a lot of experience and learning to feel out the way Demon Blades will generate fury and how to play around the resources you are sitting on.

-   Global Cooldown. The other extreme pitfall is the issue some players run into of not optimizing their global cooldown. There is usually no reason not to cast a spell every global cooldown on the dot unless you are somehow out of all fury, fury generators, and Throw Glaive stacks. Always be pressing something. If you are high on fury, press [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_chaosstrike.gif) Chaos Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=162794/chaos-strike), if you are low on fury and at no risk of capping, use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felblade.gif) Felblade](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=213241/felblade) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_sigilofinquisition.gif) Sigil of Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=389810/sigil-of-flame), if you are out of range from the boss temporarily due to a boss mechanic or heavy movement, use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_throwglaive.gif) Throw Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185123/throw-glaive). Always be using a spell every global cooldown. However when you are using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_92.gif) Demon Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203555/demon-blades) you may have unlucky windows with procs and see yourself fury starved and with no way to generate fury and nothing to spend to maintain your rotation; especially when pooling fury before a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198013/eye-beam) window. It is generally highly recommended to pair [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_92.gif) Demon Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203555/demon-blades) with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_demonhunter_a_01.gif) Master of the Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203556/master-of-the-glaive) giving you access to a second charge of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_throwglaive.gif) Throw Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185123/throw-glaive) for precisely these moments to help lower the number of empty GCDs.

Things to Improve
-----------------

In line with this, these are some quick fixes you can look to do outside of the notes posted above that can quickly be made use of in general gameplay:

* * * * *

-   With [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felrush.gif) Fel Rush](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195072/fel-rush) being an important rotational ability when talented into either [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_foundryraid_demolition.gif) Momentum](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206476/momentum) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/artifactability_vengeancedemonhunter_painbringer.gif) Unbound Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347461/unbound-chaos), there is something to talk about in regards to movement. Always be mindful of where you are and where you'll end up. We've all heard about THAT demon hunter pulling everything or THAT demon hunter Fel Rushing into fire or off a platform, be mindful of that. You should be playing proactively around your positioning to be prepared for when you must [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felrush.gif) Fel Rush](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195072/fel-rush) while minimizing your downtime or risk.

-   Cooldown usage is something to always look into for improvement, there is never one answer to fit all situations. Make yourself knowledgeable of the different raid and M+ encounters and plan your cooldowns accordingly.

-   This might not lead to a direct DPS increase, but it will lead to helping your raid group, make sure to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_blur.gif) Blur](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198589/blur) often, the cooldown is short enough that anytime damage will be incoming you should have Blur ready to be used. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_warlock_demonsoul.gif) Netherwalk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196555/netherwalk) is another defensive tool that should be utilized when possible, either to prevent you from taking a heavy hit or if no heavy hits are incoming, you can use it to stay in melee range of the boss during an AoE mechanic allowing to maintain more uptime.

-   Practice, practice, practice. World of Warcraft is no different to any games or hobby in that regard... The more time you put into the game, the more muscle memory you'll build and hopefully the more good habits you'll develop allowing you to move your attention from your rotation to other things like raid awareness, raid leading, etc.

To Momentum or not to Momentum
------------------------------

A big question anytime Momentum is a valuable talent in the current tuning pass... Let's talk about it.

* * * * *

-   You do not need to over think [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_foundryraid_demolition.gif) Momentum](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206476/momentum)! Yes, momentum is part of the more complex talents available for Havoc, but it is not overly complicated either. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_vengefulretreat2.gif) Vengeful Retreat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198793/vengeful-retreat) as much as you can to generate fury to fuel the rotation and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felrush.gif) Fel Rush](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195072/fel-rush) when you will be doing damage. Make sure to always have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_foundryraid_demolition.gif) Momentum](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206476/momentum) active whenever you [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198013/eye-beam) and other hard hitting abilities. As for the rest of the damage window fill it up with as many [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_chaosstrike.gif) Chaos Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=162794/chaos-strike) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_bladedance.gif) Blade Dance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=188499/blade-dance) when worth casting. Movement is the hardest part about Momentum, again, not something that difficult with a little bit of practice. Get a good estimate for the amount of distance [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felrush.gif) Fel Rush](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195072/fel-rush) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_vengefulretreat2.gif) Vengeful Retreat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198793/vengeful-retreat) will make you cover and look around to make sure not to pull extra targets or end up in fire. Don't forget, practice makes perfect!. Additionally, it is worth noting with the current tuning that only utilizing your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/artifactability_vengeancedemonhunter_painbringer.gif) Unbound Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347461/unbound-chaos) buffed fel rushes is a minor DPS loss making the talent less upkeep intensive.

-   This next common mistake might seem weird looking at the previous one but remains a fact in the Havoc community. While [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_foundryraid_demolition.gif) Momentum](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206476/momentum) may have situations or patches where it's the best talent in many situations playing alternatives should not be frowned upon. Being comfortable with your own playstyle will end up playing a large part in how well you do. All I would ask of you in that regard is that you make yourself aware of the difference between the three different talents to avoid making poor decisions. Are you comfortable doing 3% less damage in order to play your preferred talent? Yes, No? It's for you to decide but if you are not aware of the difference, it is impossible to make a well thought-out decision. Also, if [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_foundryraid_demolition.gif) Momentum](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206476/momentum) is the best talent in some aspect of the game, give it a try? Do it in content that is not progression like Normal or Heroic dungeons or even LFR, and maybe you'll find a new playstyle you enjoy :).

General Log Analysis Tips
-------------------------

Do bear in mind that looking at Havoc logs can sometimes be quite frustrating, esp when looking for Momentum windows. With that said, these are some quick tips when looking at your reports to try to identify issues:

* * * * *

-   [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/) is a good place to start; the website will highlight fury management issues amongst with other useful information. Currently not fully supported but can be used for fury management still.

-   [Here](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/15124.png) is where you'll be able to find information regarding Fury generation / waste on [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/).

-   [Here](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/15125.png) is where you can highlight your momentum damage windows. You can use the "+" icon next to any buffs / casts and colapse everything in the main graph in order to get a global view. Using bright colors will help highlight what you want to look at more closely. Obviously we are looking at having as much hard hitting abilities inside momentum and mostly fury generation ability outside.
