### Tier Set Bonus Gameplay Changes for Havoc Demon Hunter

The gameplay changes caused by the tier set focus on the priority and value of talents surrounding [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_throwglaive.gif) Throw Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185123/throw-glaive). As soon as the 2-Piece is equipped all builds will take every [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_throwglaive.gif) Throw Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185123/throw-glaive) buffing talent, while the tier set also reduces the active usage of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_throwglaive.gif) Throw Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185123/throw-glaive) significantly due to the free cast on every [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_bladedance.gif) Blade Dance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=188499/blade-dance) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_artifactaldrochi_d_02dual.gif) Death Sweep](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=210152/death-sweep). The 4-Piece makes no real difference in gameplay except reducing the cooldown of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ardenweald_demonhunter.gif) The Hunt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370965/the-hunt) from 1.5 minutes to around 50 seconds.

However, you can use any 4 combination of the five pieces, aiming to achieve the highest overall item level while still maintaining the tier set bonus.

When to Break Your Season 2 Havoc Demon Hunter Set
--------------------------------------------------

For Havoc Demon Hunter, you will want to break your Season 2 4-Piece bonus, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engineering.gif) Demon Hunter Havoc 10.1 Class Set 4pc](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=405507/demon-hunter-havoc-10-1-class-set-4pc), as early as possible when you are able to access your season 3 2-Piece tier set bonus, as the previous set isn't impactful enough while the Season 3 2-Piece is incredibly impactful.

How to Acquire your Havoc Demon Hunter Tier Set Bonus in Dragonflight Season 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tier Sets can be acquired in three distinct ways:

-   Raiding - dropped by specific bosses in the Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope.

-   Great Vault - obtained by all activities that give Great Vault rewards, including raiding, Mythic+, and PvP.

-   Revival Catalyst Crafting - creating Tier armor from non-set pieces of the same item level using the new Revival Catalyst crafting system.

This is a big change from previous expansions' Class Tier Sets, which could only be obtained through raiding. Players who choose to focus on Mythic+ or PvP activities can acquire them through the Great Vault, and players who prefer to create their own armor through the new crafting systems will also have an opportunity to earn Class Tier Sets.

For Season 3, the Revival Catalyst will be unlocked for everyone from the start, but will only generate one charge every two weeks.
