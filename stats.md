Havoc Demon Hunter Stats
-------------------------------------

### Primary stats

- Agility: This is your primary stat, found on all gear except necklaces and rings, though some trinkets may forego Agility as well. It scales extremely well with increased item level. Agility increases your attack power and damage done with abilities.

### Secondaries

For secondary stats, the Havoc Demon Hunter has the following:

- Critical Strike: As all abilities can crit, this has the potential to increase our damage by a large amount. Havoc Demon Hunters have multiple Critical Strike interactions in their talents which can shift the value of the stat heavily.

- Haste: This stat increases the proc rate of nearly everything in the game, aside from traits and trinkets that provide stats on proc. It also reduces the cooldown of some of our spells and reduces the global cooldown by up to a maximum of 100%, from 1.5 seconds down to 0.75 seconds. However, it continues to reduce other cooldowns beyond that as well as increasing proc rates with no limit, so it does not get significantly worse at any point.

- Versatility: This stat provides a general increase to damage and healing done, as well as reducing damage taken at half the rate. It works against all forms of damage, so it is the most effective general purpose stat for damage reduction.

- Mastery: This stat increases the chaos damage we do as well as our movement speed. The scaling is great on the stat but the share of our damage that is affected heavily relies on talent choices and AoE vs ST.

### Tertiaries

These are bonus stats that can sometimes appear on gear. They do not factor into your decisions unless you have two of the same item with different tertiaries. They are nice to have.

- Leech: This grants you a portion of your damage and healing, excluding the healing from  Soul Fragment as healing. It cannot crit and is not affected by Versatility.

- Speed: This makes you run a bit faster.

- Avoidance: This allows you to take reduced damage from AoE attacks. It has a cap of 20%.

- Indestructible: This causes your armor to have no durability, so it doesn't need to be repaired.

### Stat Priority

There are no set stat numbers to look for, nor are there any stat caps. You do not aim for a certain percentage of any stat.

In general, before applying the following stat priority, item level takes precedence over any stats. You should only compare stats when the item levels are within a specific range for certain slots. Sockets further adds to this so keep an eye out for those.

#### Raid

- Item Level

- Critical Strike

- Mastery

- Haste

- Versatility

- ilvl >= Critical Strike > Mastery > Haste = Versatility

Critical Strike scales incredibly well due to  Know Your Enemy.

Mastery is generally close, it has decent scaling on single target but without  Any Means Necessary it falls a bit behind the curve.

Haste is our next most important stat due to reducing our cooldowns, global cooldown, and increasing fury generation.

Versatility is last due to scaling damage the worst, though it comes with a survivability gain.

#### Mythic+

- Item Level

- Critical Strike

- Mastery

- Versatility

- Haste

- ilvl >= Critical Strike > Mastery > Versatility > Haste

Critical Strike scales incredibly well due to talents such as  Know Your Enemy and  Ragefire.

Mastery scales well considering the damage share that Chaos damage has in our kit, especially when paired with  Any Means Necessary.

Versatility is third due to poor scaling, however it comes with a survivability gain.

Haste is last since most of the value gained results in more single target which isn't always relevant in Mythic+.
