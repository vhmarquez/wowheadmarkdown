Leveling Overview for Havoc Demon Hunter in Dragonflight
--------------------------------------------------------

With the beginning of Dragonflight Havoc Demon Hunters now start at level 8, up until you get access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_blur.gif) Blur](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=198589/blur) and even later [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_soulcleave2.gif) Soul Rending](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=204909/soul-rending) I recommend being careful with your pulls. Very early you will gain access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=198013/eye-beam) at level 11 and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_bladedance.gif) Blade Dance](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=188499/blade-dance) at level 15 which will open up access to AoE, but you should stick to single or small pulls prior to this. You also lack any survivability or defensive power until you gain the above abilities or talents, and up until you get Soul Rending you must be careful with pull size relying mostly on [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warlock_soullink.gif) Shattered Souls](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=178940/shattered-souls) for any form of sustain. Once you have gained access to Soul Rending I recommend doing AoE pulls when you can utilizing Havoc's heavy self sustain for safety.

Havoc Demon Hunter Leveling Viability in Dragonflight
-----------------------------------------------------

Havoc is exceptionally good for leveling, with great mobility via [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_fleetfooted.gif) Double Jump](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=196055/double-jump), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_glide.gif) Glide](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=131347/glide), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felrush.gif) Fel Rush](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=195072/fel-rush) we have the ability to cross short distances exceptionally fast without mounting. We also gain access to amazing sustain as we level up (Though not right away!) allowing us to pull what we want when we want with little if any risk. Havoc also has great burst potential riddled throughout their tree which allows you to clear mobs during the level experience with little difficulty and time spent.

Havoc Demon Hunter Leveling Tips for Dragonflight
-------------------------------------------------

-   Utilize [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=198013/eye-beam) as a good AoE cooldown when it's up.

-   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_warlock_demonsoul.gif) Netherwalk](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=196555/netherwalk) can be used for the movement speed as well as the 100% damage reduction.

-   Remember that double jump gliding is an exceptionally fast form of movement for shorter distances.

Best Havoc Demon Hunter Talent Builds for Leveling in Dragonflight
------------------------------------------------------------------

The build below is the recommended ending build in your levelling experience, I have avoided going through [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_foundryraid_demolition.gif) Momentum](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=206476/momentum) for learning players and it's general frustrating usage in the open-world eating up mobility, but if you would like to play this playstyle you can go through the left side of the tree with no issues. The important things to note for levelling is increases in survivability being important, especially early on. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_creature_poison_01_purple.gif) Demonic Appetite](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=206478/demonic-appetite) is your first talent to rush to allowing for some sustain while in combat, next is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Charred Warblades](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=213010/charred-warblades) which works off of all your Chaos damage as well as Fire damage, and lastly [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_soulcleave2.gif) Soul Rending](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=204909/soul-rending) when paired with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonform.gif) Demonic](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=213410/demonic) will keep you healthy regardless of what you wish to pull. I will also note I would not recommend talenting into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_92.gif) Demon Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=203555/demon-blades) until you have access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_felblade.gif) Felblade](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=232893/felblade), it is not smooth until felblade is gained for the access to fury generation and will feel very clunky; if you prefer [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_glave_01.gif) Demon's Bite](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=162243/demons-bite) to Demon Blades that's fine too and you can play it without issue!

The levelling rotation stays the same in Single Target and AoE scenarios, there is very little to change to optimize damage since most of Havoc's abilities used on single target cleave. The only note is Blade Dance is not used in single target until level 17 when you talent into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_deathwing_bloodcorruption_death.gif) First Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=206416/first-blood).

Havoc Demon Hunter Cooldown Usage While Leveling in Dragonflight
----------------------------------------------------------------

Havoc's only major cooldown in dragonflight is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_metamorphasisdps.gif) Metamorphosis](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=191427/metamorphosis). It is geared mostly towards Single Target though it provides value in AoE scenarios as well, and can be used whenever you feel it is necessary. Once you have talented into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_soulcleave2.gif) Soul Rending](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=204909/soul-rending) it will gain a good amount of self-sustain as well for defensive value in larger pulls. We have some more minor cooldowns you may talent into in higher levels such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ardenweald_demonhunter.gif) The Hunt](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=370965/the-hunt) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bastion_demonhunter.gif) Elysian Decree](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=389815/elysian-decree), both are best to throw on cooldown but do great in AoE scenarios and The Hunt can be used for mobility with it's 50 yard charge range. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=198013/eye-beam) is a short-term cooldown, used just for a large amount of damage up until you get [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonform.gif) Demonic](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=213410/demonic) which gives a great amount of survivability and burst damage for each Eye Beam usage. Lastly [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_ritualofsacrifice.gif) Essence Break](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=258860/essence-break) is received as a very late talent choice and is simply used after an [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_eyebeam.gif) Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=198013/eye-beam) to buff up your abilities in your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonform.gif) Demonic](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=213410/demonic) window.
