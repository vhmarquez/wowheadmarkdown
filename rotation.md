Havoc Demon Hunter Openers
--------------------------
Havoc Demon Hunter has some changes to the opener depending on build, and for some builds RNG procs of  A Fire Inside can change the opening rotation to prevent over capping. While a few talents can change the opener slightly such as  Elysian Decree or  Glaive Tempest these are minor. The 3 main core builds of Havoc Demon Hunter are different enough in talent options that I have separated them out for clarity.

### Inertia
This build always takes the movement supporting talents including  Inertia and  A Fire Inside on the left, and  Immolation Aura supportive talents down the right. A couple of choices can be changed below:
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
 OPTIONS
 A Fire Inside‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎
 T31 Tier 2pc‎	 Elysian Decree‎
#### OPENER
- Cast  Immolation Aura 1 second pre-pull
- Cast  Elysian Decree
- Cast  Felblade if  A Fire Inside did not proc
- Cast  Eye Beam if  A Fire Inside did not proc
- Cast  Fel Rush to spend  Unbound Chaos
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Immolation Aura if  A Fire Inside did proc to avoid overcapping
- Cast  Fel Rush if  Unbound Chaos is up to avoid overcapping. Repeat as necessary
- Cast  Eye Beam (if  A Fire Inside proc'd and its not on cooldown already)
- Cast  Vengeful Retreat
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Essence Break
- Cast Death Sweep
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Annihilation until your  Essence Break window ends
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Throw Glaive
#### INERTIA OPENER NOTES
Your opener will vary depending on  A Fire Inside resets, try to use any extra  Immolation Aura procs and  Fel Rush with  Unbound Chaos to make use of your procs without unnecessarily wasting any time on the cooldown.
### Momentum
This build always takes  Momentum and movement supporting talents, also talenting into  Cycle of Hatred and  Shattered Destiny specializing in pure single target DPS. There are not any suggested talents to swap around for this build.
#### OPENER
- Cast  Immolation Aura 1 second pre-pull
- Cast  Fel Rush to spend  Unbound Chaos
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Vengeful Retreat
- Cast  Essence Break
- Cast Death Sweep
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Annihilation until your  Essence Break window ends
- Cast  Eye Beam
#### MOMENTUM OPENER NOTES
It is important to utilize your opener exactly as shown in regards to  Annihilation timing due to  Inner Demon not stacking and overwriting if you cast  Metamorphosis or  Eye Beam with the buff up already, both of which give  Inner Demon on cast even while already in demon form.
This is a setup assuming you're talented into  Furious Gaze, or have similar effects to  Bloodlust making you able to land both sweeps within the essence break window. Without enough Haste you will not fit the entire second  Death Sweep in the 4 second amplification window.
### No Mover
This build removes all movement supporting talents on the left, changing them out for other options such as  Blind Fury,  Critical Chaos, and  Improved Chaos Strike. A couple of choices can be changed below:
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
#### OPTIONS
 Glaive Tempest‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎	 T31 Tier 2pc‎
#### OPENER
- Cast  Immolation Aura 1 second pre-pull
- Cast  Felblade for fury
- Cast  Glaive Tempest
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Essence Break
- Cast Death Sweep
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Annihilation until your  Essence Break window ends
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Throw Glaive
#### NO MOVER OPENER NOTES
The opener is very simplified on this build as it removes much of the complexity of the kit involving multiple movement buttons no longer being in the rotation.

## Havoc Demon Hunter ST Priority List
There are significant shifts in how the variations of Havoc play from a priority/rotational standpoint. No Mover in particular entirely cuts out  Fel Rush and  Vengeful Retreat, losing major burst windows through the talents it drops. Inertia and Momentum differ significantly in how they utilize  Fel Rush, and in uptime of  Metamorphosis.

### Inertia
This build always takes the movement supporting talents including  Inertia and  A Fire Inside on the left, and  Immolation Aura supportive talents down the right. A couple of choices can be changed below:
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
#### OPTIONS
 A Fire Inside‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎
 T31 Tier 2pc‎	 Elysian Decree‎
#### PRIORITY
- Cast  Death Sweep while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  Annihilation while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  Fel Rush if  Unbound Chaos is up and  Immolation Aura is at 2 charges
- Cast  Immolation Aura if at 2 charges
- Cast  Immolation Aura if  Eye Beam or  Essence Break are up within 3 gcds
- Cast  Fel Rush if  Unbound Chaos is up
- Cast  Vengeful Retreat
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Elysian Decree
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Essence Break if in demon form
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Metamorphosis if  Eye Beam is on cooldown
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Blade Dance
- Cast  Throw Glaive at or about to hit 2 charges
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Felblade under 80 fury
- Cast  Sigil of Flame under 90 fury
- Cast  Throw Glaive
- Cast  Immolation Aura
- Cast  Throw Glaive if you will overcap charges before your next  Blade Dance or  Death Sweep
- Cast  Chaos Strike
- Cast  Fel Rush with nothing else to cast or fury to spend
#### INERTIA ROTATION NOTES
Due to the multiple charges of  Immolation Aura you can often hold casting the spell so your  Unbound Chaos that grants  Inertia can be used at a more advantageous time regarding other cooldowns coming up such as  Essence Break.

### Momentum
This build always takes  Momentum and movement supporting talents, also talenting into  Cycle of Hatred and  Shattered Destiny specializing in pure single target DPS. There are not any suggested talents to swap around for this build.
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
#### OPTIONS
 T31 Tier 2pc‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎
#### PRIORITY
- Cast  Fel Rush if  Unbound Chaos has less than 2 seconds remaining
- Cast  Vengeful Retreat
- Cast  Death Sweep while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  Annihilation while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Essence Break if in demon form
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Metamorphosis if  Eye Beam is on cooldown
- Cast  Annihilation if  Inner Demon is up
- Cast  Fel Rush if  Eye Beam is up in 1 global and  Fel Rush is under 5s duration
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Blade Dance
- Cast  Throw Glaive at or about to hit 2 charges
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Felblade under 80 fury
- Cast  Sigil of Flame under 90 fury
- Cast  Throw Glaive
- Cast  Immolation Aura
- Cast  Throw Glaive if you will overcap charges before your next  Blade Dance or  Death Sweep
- Cast  Chaos Strike
- Cast  Fel Rush
#### MOMENTUM ROTATION NOTES
The  Momentum build is exclusively recommended for pure single target encounters with high uptime, due to  Cycle of Hatred and  Shattered Destiny any forced downtime or lost globals lead to massively reduced  Metamorphosis uptime and cooldown desyncing causing it to fall behind other ST builds.

### No Mover
This build removes all movement supporting talents on the left, changing them out for other options such as  Blind Fury,  Critical Chaos, and  Improved Chaos Strike. A couple of choices can be changed below:
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
#### OPTIONS
 Glaive Tempest‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎	 T31 Tier 2pc‎
#### PRIORITY
- Cast  Death Sweep while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  Annihilation while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Essence Break if in demon form
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Glaive Tempest
- Cast  Metamorphosis if  Eye Beam is on cooldown
- Cast  Annihilation if  Inner Demon is up
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Blade Dance
- Cast  Throw Glaive at or about to hit 2 charges
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Felblade under 80 fury
- Cast  Sigil of Flame under 90 fury
- Cast  Throw Glaive
- Cast  Immolation Aura
- Cast  Throw Glaive if you will overcap charges before your next  Blade Dance or  Death Sweep
- Cast  Chaos Strike
- Cast  Fel Rush if nothing is left to cast
#### NO MOVER ROTATION NOTES
The rotation is very similar to the other builds just with removal of  Vengeful Retreat and  Fel Rush.  Fel Rush is supposed be used for a dps gain if there is no button available, but not casting it on this build for players uncomfortable with the movement will result in a minor dps loss compared to Inertia or Momentum.

## Havoc Demon Hunter AoE Priority List
AoE priority changes more based on build types and mythic+ will have different builds from raid. The only big variations are regarding committing fully to movement through  Inertia or a couple choices such as  Glaive Tempest or  Fel Barrage
### Ignition
This build always takes the movement supporting talents including  Inertia and  A Fire Inside on the left, and  Immolation Aura supportive talents down the right including  Ragefire. A couple of choices can be changed below:
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
#### OPTIONS
 A Fire Inside‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎	 Glaive Tempest‎
 T31 Tier 2pc‎	 Essence Break‎	 Fel Barrage‎
#### PRIORITY
- Cast  Death Sweep while  Essence Break is on the target
- Cast  Immolation Aura
- Cast  Fel Rush if  Unbound Chaos is up
- Cast  Vengeful Retreat
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Essence Break if in Demon Form
- Cast  Metamorphosis if  Eye Beam is on cooldown
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Fel Barrage if over 90 fury (see below more details)
- Cast  Glaive Tempest
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Blade Dance
- Cast  Sigil of Flame
- Cast  Throw Glaive
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Felblade under 80 fury
- Cast  Throw Glaive if you will overcap charges before your next  Blade Dance or  Death Sweep
- Cast  Fel Rush
- Cast  Chaos Strike
#### IGNITION ROTATION NOTES
- While  Fel Barrage is active you need to change your rotation to reduce spending fury to maintain it for the full 8 second duration. There is no clean way to add this to the priority list above so it is being mentioned here that utilizing  Felblade and not casting  Annihilation is recommended to maintain the buff.
- To properly set up  Fel Barrage you will want to have at least one  Immolation Aura charge, ideally two. Utilize your immolation aura and  Fel Rush prior to casting  Fel Barrage, and use  Vengeful Retreat after to increase your fury generation per second from  Tactical Retreat. At this point keep an eye on your fury and utilize  Felblade and  Sigil of Flame to stay high on fury, you can make use of  Eye Beam and  Death Sweep as you will typically have enough fury to finish out the barrage and cast these.
- Your damage will vary heavily depending on  A Fire Inside resets, try to use any extra  Immolation Aura procs and  Fel Rush with  Unbound Chaos to make use of your procs without unnecessarily wasting any time on the cooldown.
- Fel Rush simply outdamages  Chaos Strike in 3+ targets due to the buff to the base damage of Fel Rush in patch 10.2.

### Low Mover
This build removes most movement supporting talents on the left, excluding  Initiative which is kept as a near required talent in mythic+ scenarios. Only having to use  Vengeful Retreat for damage has dubbed it 'low mover'. A couple of choices can be changed below:
Use the X markers next to selected talents and tier to populate the priority list.
#### OPTIONS
 A Fire Inside‎	 Chaotic Transformation‎	 Essence Break‎
 T31 Tier 2pc‎	 Elysian Decree‎	 Fel Barrage‎
#### PRIORITY
- Cast  Immolation Aura
- Cast  Vengeful Retreat
- Cast  The Hunt
- Cast  Elysian Decree
- Cast  Essence Break
- Cast  Metamorphosis if  Eye Beam is on cooldown
- Cast  Metamorphosis
- Cast  Death Sweep
- Cast  Fel Barrage if over 60 fury
- Cast  Glaive Tempest
- Cast  Eye Beam
- Cast  Blade Dance
- Cast  Sigil of Flame
- Cast  Throw Glaive
- Cast  Annihilation
- Cast  Felblade under 80 fury
- Cast  Throw Glaive if you will overcap charges before your next  Blade Dance or  Death Sweep
- Cast  Chaos Strike
- Cast  Fel Rush
#### LOW MOVER ROTATION NOTES
- Low mover as a build exists purely for players that would like to avoid utilizing movement and specifically  Fel Rush in their rotation. Removing  Initiative as a talent is a massive dps loss in mythic+ due to the consistent rate of free procs and therefor is nearly impossible to justify dropping, forcing it to be talented.
- While  Fel Barrage is active you need to change your rotation to reduce spending fury to maintain it for the full 8 second duration. There is no clean way to add this to the priority list above so it is being mentioned here that utilizing  Felblade and not casting  Annihilation is recommended to maintain the buff.
