Recommended Gear for Havoc Demon Hunter in Dragonflight
-------------------------------------------------------

### What is the BiS Havoc Demon Hunter gear?

With many different sources of gearing and loot scarcity in Dragonflight, targeting your absolute Best in Slot gear isn't entirely realistic; instead, we've created a Best in Slot list from the ideal Havoc Demon Hunter drops found in Dragonflight from Mythic+ Dungeons and Amirdrassil to help you decide what to prioritize.While raid drops are generally the most reliable way of getting high item level gear, many other items can be just as good, if not better, so you should reference the stat priorities listed on the [stats page](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/demon-hunter/havoc/stat-priority-pve-dps) and our [Raidbots guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-raidbots-and-run-character-simulations-6050) to help determine your own BiS gear based on what is available to you.As a very rough guideline follow the stat priority of: Critical Strike > Mastery > Haste = Versatility. Don't neglect the value of Agility, a substantial increase in item level is generally worth it compared to optimized stats. It is always recommended that you use [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/stats) to sim your own character since every character is different.

### Overall Havoc Demon Hunter Best in Slot

It is worth noting for single target [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hand_1h_emeralddreamraid_d_01.gif) Thorncaller Claw](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207784/thorncaller-claw) can be run over [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time), these weapons have similar value and item level will determine the stronger option in all scenarios. For AoE you have a preference of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time) however once again item level will be able to put [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hand_1h_emeralddreamraid_d_01.gif) Thorncaller Claw](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207784/thorncaller-claw) ahead.

### Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope Best in Slot Gear for Havoc Demon Hunter

While raid items are more deterministically obtainable than Mythic+ ones, there can be usually heavy competition for them. Make sure you are always aiming for item level upgrades as those will be usually worth it even if you're obtaining items with poor itemization. Overall, for raids, Havoc Demon Hunters will be looking into items with Critical Strike and Mastery.

Best Havoc Demon Hunter Trinkets in Dragonflight
------------------------------------------------

Havoc Demon Hunters are mainly looking for one on use trinket, and a powerful damage proc trinket in single target or a stat proc trinket in AoE. The stats Havoc is most looking for on trinkets are Critical Strike and Mastery for raid, but all stats have value once you have enough Critical Strike. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) seems to be a generic powerful choice in all scenarios for Season 3, however the mini game to play around it may dissuade many players from wanting to play it.

| Grade | Trinket | Drop Location | Notes |
| S | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/archaeology_5_0_warlordsbrandingiron.gif) Cataclysmic Signet Brand](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207166/cataclysmic-signet-brand?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Smolderon](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=214082/smolderon) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Heavy damage single target proc that ramps stacks up on you with consistent combat, deals self-damage over 5 stacks. Incredibly strong single-target raid trinket and highest priority to get for single target. |
| S- | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [The Everbloom](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=7109/the-everbloom) | Summons 3 orbs giving a stack of a massive amount of mastery per orb picked up, picking up each orb re-extends the buff to 10 seconds meaning you want to delay it out. Best to use in advance of cooldowns to be rolling between 2-3 stacks. BiS in single target and potent in AoE. |
| A+ | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/sha_spell_fire_felfire_nightmare.gif) Ashes of the Embersoul](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207167/ashes-of-the-embersoul?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Smolderon](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=214082/smolderon) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Can be used for a massive amount of Agility in burst windows around [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_metamorphasisdps.gif) Metamorphosis](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=191427/metamorphosis), however the base haste on the trinket devalues it pretty significantly. Exceptional in AoE scenarios, loses hard to good ST proc trinkets for single target scenarios however. |
| A+ | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/10_2_raidability_green.gif) Pip's Emerald Friendship Badge](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207168/pips-emerald-friendship-badge?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Urctos](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=208363/urctos) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Stat stick trinket that's fine in single target scenarios and relatively powerful in M+ and cleave. Always a fine trinket to run. |
| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelcrafting_rubyserpent.gif) Coiled Serpent Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207175/coiled-serpent-idol?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Volcoross](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=208478/volcoross) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Powerful proc trinket for single target. |
| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/achievement_dungeon_ulduarraid_misc_06.gif) Mirror of Fractured Tomorrows](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207581/mirror-of-fractured-tomorrows?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Dawn of the Infinite](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14514/dawn-of-the-infinite) | Gives a large critical strike buff and deals mediocre damage from the image, better in AoE than single target but an okay option in both. |
| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_cape_special_knifebandolier_c_01.gif) Bandolier of Twisted Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207165/bandolier-of-twisted-blades?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Igira the Cruel](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=206689/igira-the-cruel) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Requires repositioning to hit as many targets as possible in AoE, not the best in ST or AoE but relatively high in both scenarios. |
| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ui_majorfaction_shadowflame.gif) Augury of the Primal Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/item=208614/augury-of-the-primal-flame?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | Fyrakk - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Good passive trinket, dealing bonus damage off of your critical strikes. This trinket deals great damage in Single Target scenarios but quickly falls off in value in cleave/AoE. |
| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_7_0raid_trinket_010c.gif) Ember of Nullification](https://www.wowhead.com/item=136978/ember-of-nullification?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Black Rook Hold](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=7805/black-rook-hold) | A good passive mythic+ trinket option, giving flat versatility and agility at all times. Second best behind Pip's for a stat stick. |
| A- | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_offhand_draenei_a_02.gif) My'das Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/item=158319/mydas-talisman?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Atal'Dazar](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=9028/ataldazar) | Good single target damage with zero AoE value, typically not recommended but can be decent temporarily for raid. |
| B+ | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelcrafting_purplecrab.gif) Porcelain Crab](https://www.wowhead.com/item=133192/porcelain-crab?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Throne of the Tides](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=5004/throne-of-the-tides) | A good passive mythic+ trinket option, giving high uptime on moderate mastery and avoidance. |
| B | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bossmagistrix_timewarp2.gif) Accelerating Sandglass](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207566/accelerating-sandglass?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Dawn of the Infinite](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14514/dawn-of-the-infinite) | Haste proc with relatively low value that turns into a damage proc, not tuned as well as other trinkets for Havoc. |
| F | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cat_trinket09.gif) Nightmare Egg Shell](https://www.wowhead.com/item=137312/nightmare-egg-shell?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Darkheart Thicket](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=7673/darkheart-thicket) | Not a good havoc trinket, the proc is not good enough to run as is. |
| F | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_6_2raid_trinket_4b.gif) Spiked Counterweight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=136715/spiked-counterweight?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [Black Rook Hold](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=7805/black-rook-hold) | The damage proc is too small to deal damage worth equipping as a haste trinket, not good in any content. |

Best Items to Upgrade with Dreaming Crests for Havoc Demon Hunters
------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981)

-   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hand_1h_emeralddreamraid_d_01.gif) Thorncaller Claw](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207784/thorncaller-claw?bonus=7981:9576:1520) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) Off-hand, incredibly similar in value.

-   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981)

-   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/archaeology_5_0_warlordsbrandingiron.gif) Cataclysmic Signet Brand](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207166/cataclysmic-signet-brand?bonus=7981:9576:1520)

With Dreaming Crests being a limited currency, Havoc Demon Hunters should focus on upgrading a single weapon first, and trinkets second. After that, you will want to upgrade any special items you have acquired such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time) before moving on to upgrade trinkets, then tier pieces or lowest item level pieces with good stats.

Dragonflight adds many new options for crafted gear, allowing players to craft even Mythic-equivalent gear! You'll generally want to supplement gear from Raids and Mythic+ with crafted pieces. Note that crafting is limited by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams). After receiving your first [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams) from the first week of Season 3, you will receive another [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams) every other week while Season 3 is active.

### Best Gear to Spend Spark of Dreams for Havoc Demon Hunter

Once you obtain [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams), you should aim to craft the following items at the highest item level possible. Note that you may use the [recrafting system](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/professions/recrafting-system) to increase its item level later if you so desire. After crafting your best pieces, you can use sparks to improve slots that you have the lowest item level pieces, aiming to increase your average item level.

Filling out any slots that are not a high level except ideal Tier Piece slots is viable, as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1.gif) Blue Silken Lining ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining) can be embellished on to most crafted pieces/slots except pre-embellished pieces. Rings can be high value if you do not have a socket on your current rings.

1.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_leather_dragonpvp_d_01.gif) Life-Bound Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193407/life-bound-belt?bonus=9498:1508:8791)

2.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_leather_dragonpvp_d_01.gif) Life-Bound Bindings](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193419/life-bound-bindings?bonus=9498:1508:8791)

3.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_jewelcrafting_rings_ring2_color3.gif) Signet of Titanic Insight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=192999/signet-of-titanic-insight?bonus=9498:1508:8791)

### Best Embellishments for Havoc Demon Hunters

Crafting [items with Embellishments](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/professions/embellishment-crafted-gear-optional-reagents) gives them special properties and effects in addition to regular stats. However, you may only wear 2 pieces of gear with Embellishments at a time. With that in mind, the best Embellishments are:

1.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1.gif) Blue Silken Lining ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining)

2.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1.gif) Blue Silken Lining ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining) x2

3.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_food_legion_goochocovanilla_bottle.gif) Alchemical Flavor Pocket](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200652/alchemical-flavor-pocket) which also does not take up one of your two embellishments slots.

4.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_leather_dragondungeon_c_01_boot.gif) Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps?bonus=9498:1508) Competitive on Single Target vs Blue Silken Lining.

5.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cataclysmarmorkit_10.gif) Toxified Armor Patch ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193555/toxified-armor-patch) Only when paired with Toxic Thorn Footwraps.Recommended Gear for Havoc Demon Hunter in Dragonflight
-------------------------------------------------------

### What is the BiS Havoc Demon Hunter gear?

With many different sources of gearing and loot scarcity in Dragonflight, targeting your absolute Best in Slot gear isn't entirely realistic; instead, we've created a Best in Slot list from the ideal Havoc Demon Hunter drops found in Dragonflight from Mythic+ Dungeons and Amirdrassil to help you decide what to prioritize.While raid drops are generally the most reliable way of getting high item level gear, many other items can be just as good, if not better, so you should reference the stat priorities listed on the [stats page](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/demon-hunter/havoc/stat-priority-pve-dps) and our [Raidbots guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-raidbots-and-run-character-simulations-6050) to help determine your own BiS gear based on what is available to you.As a very rough guideline follow the stat priority of: Critical Strike > Mastery > Haste = Versatility. Don't neglect the value of Agility, a substantial increase in item level is generally worth it compared to optimized stats. It is always recommended that you use [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/stats) to sim your own character since every character is different.

### Overall Havoc Demon Hunter Best in Slot

It is worth noting for single target [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hand_1h_emeralddreamraid_d_01.gif) Thorncaller Claw](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207784/thorncaller-claw) can be run over [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time), these weapons have similar value and item level will determine the stronger option in all scenarios. For AoE you have a preference of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time) however once again item level will be able to put [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hand_1h_emeralddreamraid_d_01.gif) Thorncaller Claw](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207784/thorncaller-claw) ahead.

### Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope Best in Slot Gear for Havoc Demon Hunter

While raid items are more deterministically obtainable than Mythic+ ones, there can be usually heavy competition for them. Make sure you are always aiming for item level upgrades as those will be usually worth it even if you're obtaining items with poor itemization. Overall, for raids, Havoc Demon Hunters will be looking into items with Critical Strike and Mastery.

Best Havoc Demon Hunter Trinkets in Dragonflight
------------------------------------------------

Havoc Demon Hunters are mainly looking for one on use trinket, and a powerful damage proc trinket in single target or a stat proc trinket in AoE. The stats Havoc is most looking for on trinkets are Critical Strike and Mastery for raid, but all stats have value once you have enough Critical Strike. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) seems to be a generic powerful choice in all scenarios for Season 3, however the mini game to play around it may dissuade many players from wanting to play it.

| Grade | Trinket | Drop Location | Notes |
| S | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/archaeology_5_0_warlordsbrandingiron.gif) Cataclysmic Signet Brand](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207166/cataclysmic-signet-brand?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Smolderon](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=214082/smolderon) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Heavy damage single target proc that ramps stacks up on you with consistent combat, deals self-damage over 5 stacks. Incredibly strong single-target raid trinket and highest priority to get for single target. |
| S- | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=657:9499:5871:7981) | [The Everbloom](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=7109/the-everbloom) | Summons 3 orbs giving a stack of a massive amount of mastery per orb picked up, picking up each orb re-extends the buff to 10 seconds meaning you want to delay it out. Best to use in advance of cooldowns to be rolling between 2-3 stacks. BiS in single target and potent in AoE. |
| A+ | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/sha_spell_fire_felfire_nightmare.gif) Ashes of the Embersoul](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207167/ashes-of-the-embersoul?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Smolderon](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=214082/smolderon) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Can be used for a massive amount of Agility in burst windows around [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_demonhunter_metamorphasisdps.gif) Metamorphosis](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=191427/metamorphosis), however the base haste on the trinket devalues it pretty significantly. Exceptional in AoE scenarios, loses hard to good ST proc trinkets for single target scenarios however. |
| A+ | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/10_2_raidability_green.gif) Pip's Emerald Friendship Badge](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207168/pips-emerald-friendship-badge?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Urctos](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=208363/urctos) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Stat stick trinket that's fine in single target scenarios and relatively powerful in M+ and cleave. Always a fine trinket to run. |
| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelcrafting_rubyserpent.gif) Coiled Serpent Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207175/coiled-serpent-idol?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Volcoross](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=208478/volcoross) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Powerful proc trinket for single target. |

| A | [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_cape_special_knifebandolier_c_01.gif) Bandolier of Twisted Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207165/bandolier-of-twisted-blades?bonus=7981:9576:1520) | [Igira the Cruel](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=206689/igira-the-cruel) - [Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14643/amirdrassil-the-dreams-hope) | Requires repositioning to hit as many targets as possible in AoE, not the best in ST or AoE but relatively high in both scenarios. |

This trinket deals great damage in Single Target scenarios but quickly falls off in value in cleave/AoE. |

Second best behind Pip's for a stat stick. |

With Dreaming Crests being a limited currency, Havoc Demon Hunters should focus on upgrading a single weapon first, and trinkets second. After that, you will want to upgrade any special items you have acquired such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_glaive_1h_blackdragonoutdoor_d_01.gif) Double Time](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207991/double-time) before moving on to upgrade trinkets, then tier pieces or lowest item level pieces with good stats.

Crafted Gear for Havoc Demon Hunters in Dragonflight
----------------------------------------------------

Dragonflight adds many new options for crafted gear, allowing players to craft even Mythic-equivalent gear! You'll generally want to supplement gear from Raids and Mythic+ with crafted pieces. Note that crafting is limited by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams). After receiving your first [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams) from the first week of Season 3, you will receive another [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams) every other week while Season 3 is active.

### Best Gear to Spend Spark of Dreams for Havoc Demon Hunter

Once you obtain [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_misc_titansspark_emeralddream.gif) Spark of Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=206959/spark-of-dreams), you should aim to craft the following items at the highest item level possible. Note that you may use the [recrafting system](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/professions/recrafting-system) to increase its item level later if you so desire. After crafting your best pieces, you can use sparks to improve slots that you have the lowest item level pieces, aiming to increase your average item level.

Filling out any slots that are not a high level except ideal Tier Piece slots is viable, as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1.gif) Blue Silken Lining ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining) can be embellished on to most crafted pieces/slots except pre-embellished pieces. Rings can be high value if you do not have a socket on your current rings.

1.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_leather_dragonpvp_d_01.gif) Life-Bound Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193407/life-bound-belt?bonus=9498:1508:8791)

3.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_jewelcrafting_rings_ring2_color3.gif) Signet of Titanic Insight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=192999/signet-of-titanic-insight?bonus=9498:1508:8791)

### Best Embellishments for Havoc Demon Hunters

Crafting [items with Embellishments](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/professions/embellishment-crafted-gear-optional-reagents) gives them special properties and effects in addition to regular stats. However, you may only wear 2 pieces of gear with Embellishments at a time. With that in mind, the best Embellishments are:

1.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1.gif) Blue Silken Lining ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining)

2.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1.gif) Blue Silken Lining ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining) x2

3.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_food_legion_goochocovanilla_bottle.gif) Alchemical Flavor Pocket](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200652/alchemical-flavor-pocket) which also does not take up one of your two embellishments slots.

4.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_leather_dragondungeon_c_01_boot.gif) Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps?bonus=9498:1508) Competitive on Single Target vs Blue Silken Lining.

5.  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cataclysmarmorkit_10.gif) Toxified Armor Patch ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/TextureAtlas/live/professions-chaticon-quality-tier3.png)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193555/toxified-armor-patch) Only when paired with Toxic Thorn Footwraps.
